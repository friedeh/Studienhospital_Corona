<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Risk literacy as a cognitive ability is a key concept in medical education that prepares students for decision-making in clinical settings. Risk literacy can be measured with the so-called Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT; <span class="citation">[1]</span>). Unfortunately, risk literacy does not increase during the course of study <span class="citation">[2]</span>. In the Progress Test Medicine (PTM), medical students answer 200 multiple-choice questions at regular intervals during their studies to prepare for the final exam <span class="citation">[3]</span>. The PTM can be subdivided into recall and application questions which refer to concepts such as pattern recognition and deliberate practice, respectively. In our study, we aim to investigate whether a higher BNT score is associated with a higher score in application questions, both cross-domain and domain-specific.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>A higher BNT score was not significantly associated with a higher score in application questions, both cross-domain and domain-specific. Moreover, <em>medical-scientific skills</em> was the only domain that revealed a positive, yet small relation between risk literacy and the performance in the application questions of the PTM. This is a first hint for risk literacy as a domain-specific, cognitive ability.</p>

<h2>Take-home messages</h2>
<p>Risk literacy is an essential cognitive ability in clinical reasoning. However in our study, it did not show any impact on application tasks in the PTM among medical freshmen. Future research needs to clarify whether a concrete education in risk literacy leads to an increase in the PTM performance, both cross-domain and domain-specific.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Risk literacy as a cognitive ability is a key concept in medical
education that prepares students for decision-making in clinical
settings. Risk literacy can be measured with the so-called Berlin
Numeracy Test (BNT; <span class="citation">[@Cokely2012ww]</span>).
Unfortunately, risk literacy does not increase during the course of
study <span class="citation">[@Friederichs2014dd]</span>. In the
Progress Test Medicine (PTM), medical students answer 200
multiple-choice questions at regular intervals during their studies to
prepare for the final exam <span class="citation">[@nouns2010progress]</span>. The PTM can be subdivided
into recall and application questions which refer to concepts such as
pattern recognition and deliberate practice, respectively. In our study,
we aim to investigate whether a higher BNT score is associated with a
higher score in application questions, both cross-domain and
domain-specific.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>A higher BNT score was not significantly associated with a higher
score in application questions, both cross-domain and domain-specific.
Moreover, <em>medical-scientific skills</em> was the only domain that
revealed a positive, yet small relation between risk literacy and the
performance in the application questions of the PTM. This is a first
hint for risk literacy as a domain-specific, cognitive ability.</p>

<h2>Take-home messages</h2>
<p>Risk literacy is an essential cognitive ability in clinical
reasoning. However in our study, it did not show any impact on
application tasks in the PTM among medical freshmen. Future research
needs to clarify whether a concrete education in risk literacy leads to
an increase in the PTM performance, both cross-domain and
domain-specific.</p>
